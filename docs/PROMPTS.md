# AI Agent Prompts by Development Phase

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure

### Prompt for Phase 1

```
Create a Next.js portfolio website with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. For this first phase, focus only on:

1. Project initialization with the following:
   - Next.js with App Router
   - TypeScript (strict mode)
   - Tailwind CSS
   - ESLint configuration

2. Setup for a dark theme with these specific colors:
   - Background: #0f172a
   - Text: #f8fafc
   - Primary Accent: #8b5cf6
   - Create a simple gradient utility: linear-gradient(135deg, #8b5cf6 0%, #3b82f6 100%)

3. Create a basic layout with:
   - Header with navigation (Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact)
   - Mobile-friendly navigation menu
   - Footer with simple content
   - Dark/light mode toggle that saves preference to localStorage

4. Implement basic responsive behavior that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Keep the code clean and well-organized. Use semantic HTML elements, and ensure the site is accessible (WCAG AA standards). Don't implement any page content yet - just the structure.

The files should include:
- src/app/layout.tsx (main layout)
- src/app/page.tsx (empty homepage)
- src/components/layout/header.tsx
- src/components/layout/footer.tsx
- src/components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx
- tailwind.config.js (with theme configuration)

Keep comments minimal and human-like, focusing only on complex logic.
```

## Phase 2: Homepage & About Section

### Prompt for Phase 2

```
Building on the existing portfolio project, implement the homepage and about section with the following features:

1. Homepage hero section:
   - Large heading with your name "John Webbies"
   - Professional title "Senior Software Engineer"
   - Short introduction (1-2 sentences)
   - Animated gradient text effect for the heading
   - Simple fade-in animation using Motion
   - CTA button linking to the projects section

2. About section:

   - Profile image with gradient border
   - Resume download button (linking to: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tLnhpqkx5velSVuislj3g21d0ejsgjSw/view)

3. Implement scroll-triggered animations:
   - Elements should fade in as user scrolls
   - Subtle animations that enhance but don't distract

All components should be responsive and maintain the dark theme established in Phase 1. Ensure all text is readable with sufficient contrast, and all interactive elements are accessible.

Focus on building reusable components. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props. Use the Context API for any state that needs to be shared between components.
