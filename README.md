## About Me

Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building robust web applications. I specialize in full-stack development with expertise in React, Next.js, Node.js, and cloud technologies. My passion lies in creating elegant solutions to complex problems with a focus on performance, accessibility, and user experience.

I've led development teams on projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to data visualization tools, always focusing on maintainable code and scalable architecture. When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, writing technical articles, and mentoring junior developers.
